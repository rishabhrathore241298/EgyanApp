The ‘E – Gyan App’ is an Android Application basically has an aim to share pdfs, docs etc. among students for easy access to information and to get study material from fellow-mates more easily. It is a useful app for college students that overcomes the problem of inefficient Information circulation and lack of study material for studies at the exam times .  This idea came in our heads as we too have faced this problem of not getting proper study material for semester exams, as well as the notices, exam time – table and other updates were not circulated on time. The ‘E – Gyan App’ as the name signifies provides you with ‘Gyan’ (Knowledge) about new updates and efficient study material required for studies for exams. Also, the interactive UI makes the app more engaging and easy to use, this app provides a platform for easy sharing of technical news, notes, notices etc among students.
